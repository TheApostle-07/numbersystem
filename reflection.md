# Reflection on Using GitHub’s Project Management Tools

Using GitHub’s project management tools made organizing and tracking my project much easier. Creating a milestone allowed me to set clear goals, ensuring that I knew what needed to be accomplished in the first phase of the project. The milestone acted like a roadmap, helping me break down the bigger project into manageable tasks.

By creating issues for specific tasks like fixing bugs, adding new features, and general to-dos, I was able to keep track of everything in one place. The issues feature also made it simple to prioritize tasks, label them, and assign them to myself, which kept me focused on what needed attention the most.

Setting up the project board with columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" was especially helpful. It gave me a visual representation of the project's progress. Moving issues from one column to another as I worked on them gave me a clear picture of how far along I was, and it also made it easier to manage the workflow.

Linking the issues to the milestone helped me see how each task contributed to the overall goal. It made sure that every issue I worked on brought me closer to completing the milestone. Overall, GitHub’s project management tools helped me stay organized, track progress efficiently, and made project management much simpler.
